## What this game is

A **5×5 card-chain combat** game built with Phaser + React, played across a
branching **run map** (roguelite-style path of battles).

- Player drags cards from hand onto a grid; arrows define activation order.
- Player sets chain start (column 0) and clicks **Attack**.
- Chain resolves step-by-step (attack, defend, fire, poison, joker, loop, hazard, boost).
- Enemy acts with telegraphed intent (attack/shield + hazard traps).
- Win: all enemy HP ≤ 0. Lose: player HP ≤ 0.
- Multi-enemy fights: click an enemy to set your attack target before attacking; pick a new target mid-chain if the current one dies.

## Run structure

The game is a **run**: a left-to-right map of nodes connected by lines
(`src/game/run/runMap.ts`). The player picks one node per column; enemies ramp
in difficulty toward a boss (`warden`) in the final column. Each run has **9 columns**
between the opening fight and the boss (`RUN_CONFIG.middleColumns`).

- **Node kinds** (`src/game/run/nodeKinds.ts`, `RunMapNode.kind`): `enemy` and `boss`
  are battles; `shop` and `event` are non-battle stops. Each kind has an icon
  (`NodeKindIcon`, from game-icons.net) and a hover tooltip on the map. Map labels use
  generic kind names (`mapNodeDisplay.ts`) — **Street Op**, **Lieutenant**, **Signal**, **Ripperdoc**,
  **Warden** — except **Saboteur** (regular fights only) and **Warden**, which stay named. First column
  is always `enemy`; column 4 (row index 3) is always a **semi-boss** lieutenant fight
  (`smokebinder` / `saboteur`); last column is the `boss`; other middle columns are weighted-random
  (`rollNodeKind`: 70% enemy, 20% event, 10% shop). **Event nodes** open `RunEventOverlay` (`runEvents.ts`) — wheel,
  icon matcher (4×4 memory grid, 4 attempts), **combo trials** (damage puzzles), stasis patches, gambles, body mods. Shop is still a placeholder (`NodeVisitOverlay`).
- **HP carries over** between fights, with a small heal on each victory (`RUN_CONFIG.healOnVictory`).
- **Deck persists and grows**: the run owns the deck as a list of card definition ids (`getDefaultDeckDefinitionIds`). Each battle builds instances from those ids (`buildDeckFromDefinitionIds`).
- **Victory rewards**: defeating a (non-boss) enemy grants that node's reward. Today every node grants a **card reward** (`CardRewardOverlay` → pick from choices → card ids appended to the run deck).
- Losing any battle, or clearing the boss, ends the run (`RunEndOverlay` → new run).
- The map regenerates each run.

Flow: `map (pick node)` → `battle` → `win → reward → map` / `lose → defeat` / `boss win → victory`.
Non-battle nodes: `map (pick shop)` → `visit` → `map`; `map (pick event)` → `visit (RunEventOverlay)` → `map`.

### Seeds & determinism

Runs are **seed-based**: the same seed produces the same map and the same rewards,
and the same seed + same in-battle actions produces the same battle.

- All gameplay randomness routes through a single seeded RNG (`src/game/random/rng.ts`,
  mulberry32 + xmur3). **Never call `Math.random()` in gameplay code** — use `random()`,
  `randomInt()`, `pickRandom()`, or `shuffleInPlace()` from that module. (`Math.random`
  is used only inside `createRandomSeed` to pick a fresh unpredictable seed.)
- The RNG is **reseeded at deterministic boundaries** via `seedScope(seed, scope)` /
  `deriveSeed(seed, scope)`:
  - `map` — map generation (`App.buildMapForSeed`)
  - `reward:<nodeId>:<rerollIndex>` — a node's card reward (`App.rollRewardForNode`)
  - `battle:<nodeId>` — a battle's stream, reseeded in `Game.startBattle` (passed via
    the `START_BATTLE` payload `seed`)
- Because each boundary reseeds, map/reward results are **idempotent and order-independent**
  (robust to React StrictMode double-invocation); battles are reproducible given the same
  player actions (actions consume the battle stream in order).
- The player can view/enter the seed on the map before the first battle (`RunMapOverlay`).

### Rewards (variable, extensible)

Rewards are data on each map node (`RunMapNode.reward`), modeled as a discriminated
union in `src/game/run/rewards.ts`:

```
RunReward = CardReward { kind: 'card'; choiceCount; pickCount; rerollable }
```

- **Variable per node** — different enemies can grant different rewards; today all use `DEFAULT_CARD_REWARD`.
- **Body-mod-ready** — the numeric knobs are the intended extension seam:
  - `pickCount > 1` → "pick two cards"
  - `rerollable: true` → reroll the offered choices (`CardRewardOverlay` already renders the button + `App` handles reroll)
  - add new `RunReward` kinds (e.g. body-mod/creds) without touching existing handling.
- Card choices come from `REWARD_CARD_POOL` via `rollCardReward(choiceCount)`.

When adding body mods: give body mods a modifier step that adjusts the `RunReward`
before `rollCardReward`/display, or add a new `RunReward` kind + a case in `App`'s
`onBattleWon`.

## Architecture (active code only)

```
index.html → src/main.tsx → App.tsx (run controller)
  ├── PhaserGame.tsx → src/game/main.ts → scenes/Game.ts
  ├── GameHud.tsx           (battle phase)
  ├── RunMapOverlay.tsx     (map phase; node icons + tooltips)
  ├── CardRewardOverlay.tsx (reward phase)
  ├── NodeVisitOverlay.tsx  (visit phase; shop/event placeholder)
  └── RunEndOverlay.tsx     (victory / defeat)
```

`App.tsx` owns run state (map, path, carry-over HP, phase). The Phaser `Game`
scene does **not** auto-start a fight; it waits for `START_BATTLE`, builds a
battle, and emits `BATTLE_WON` / `BATTLE_LOST` back to React.

| Layer | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Run controller | `src/App.tsx` | Map/battle/end phases, carry-over HP, node picks |
| Run map | `src/game/run/runMap.ts` | Graph generation, reachability, run config |
| Session | `src/game/cardGame/domain/CardGameSession.ts` | Turn flow, board state, combat orchestration (accepts carry-over HP) |
| Combat | `src/game/cardGame/combat/AttackPipeline.ts` | Chain resolution, type streaks, off-chain bonus |
| Enemy AI | `src/game/cardGame/combat/enemyTurn.ts` | Intent, attack/shield, hazard placement |
| Passives | `src/game/cardGame/enemyPassives/` | Per-enemy counter-play |
| Config | `src/game/cardGame/config/` | `gameRules.json`, `cards.json`, `enemies.json` |
| Board UI | `src/game/board/` | Grid, hand, piles, health, armor views |
| React HUD | `src/ui/components/GameHud.tsx` | Attack, reroll controls |
| Map / end UI | `src/ui/components/RunMapOverlay.tsx`, `RunEndOverlay.tsx` | Node picking, run results |
| Event buses | `EventBus` (React↔Phaser shell, incl. `START_BATTLE`/`BATTLE_WON`/`BATTLE_LOST`), `CardGameEventBus` (in-game) |

**Shared config:** `src/game/config/gridConfig.ts` (5×5 board), `uiTypography.ts`.

---

## Core loop

```
Deploy → Attack (chain resolve, costs 1 energy, board persists) → refill hand → repeat while energy remains → energy = 0 → board clears → enemy turn → energy refills → new hand → repeat
```

The player turn is **escalating**: each Attack resolves the current board without clearing it, so later attacks chain through more cards. The hand refills to full after every attack. The enemy only acts once you've spent all your energy for the round; then the board clears and you draw a fresh hand. Each Attack spends one **energy** (`energyPerTurn`, default 3); energy refills after the enemy finishes that response. The Dead Zone (dampen) field ticks down after each enemy turn.

**Risk/reward:** the first attack of an energy round is baseline, but every *extra* attack before energy refills ramps the enemy's incoming attack damage by `enemyDamageRampPerAttack` (default 4). Spending all your energy before the refill means facing a harder-hitting enemy on those later attacks.

| Rule | Value | Config |
|------|-------|--------|
| Player HP | 80 | `gameRules.json` |
| Deck / hand | 20 / 8 | `gameRules.json` |
| Energy (attacks) per turn | 3 | `gameRules.json` (`energyPerTurn`) |
| Enemy damage ramp per extra attack | +4 | `gameRules.json` (`enemyDamageRampPerAttack`) |
| Rerolls per fight | 3 | `gameRules.json` |
| Chain start column | 0 | `gameRules.json` |
| Max chain steps | 24 | `gameRules.json` |
| Off-chain bonus | +2 damage (attack) / +2 armor (defend) on board but not in chain | `gameRules.json` |
| Type streak | +15% per duplicate attack/defend in streak | `gameRules.json` |
| Field boost | Random boost on empty tile; doubles next chain step | `gameRules.json` |
| Resolution speed | Chain step 800ms, enemy turn 800ms (snappy) | `gameRules.json` |

---

## Tactical systems (implemented)

| System | Files | Player decision |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Chain routing | `AttackPipeline.ts`, `cardDirections.ts` | Arrow pools, leap (2-tile), loop-reset, corner-turn (`cornerTurn` — hooks to a forward-diagonal, `getCornerNextSlot`) |
| Poison trail | `poisonTrailAbility.ts` | Converts subsequent defends to **poison stacks** on the enemy |
| Poison stacks (status) | `CardGameSession.tickPoison` | Enemy takes `stacks` damage at the start of each of its turns (ignores shield), then stacks decay by 1 |
| Fire alternation | `fireAlternationAbility.ts` | +3 damage per alternating attack/defend after fire |
| Bleed (Rupture / Shiv / Lacerate) | `bleedAbility.ts` | +2 damage per attack in the chain beyond 2 (rewards attack-heavy chains) |
| Fortify (Bulwark / Bramble) | `fortifyAbility.ts` | +2 armor per defend in the chain beyond 2 (rewards defend-heavy chains) |
| Overload (Surge) | `overloadAbility.ts` | +3 damage per other skill card in the chain, doubled if a Joker activates |
| Combo starters | `cards.json` — Shiv, Miasma, Cinder, Lacerate, Scorch, Bramble | Diagonal/corner/lunge variants that pair routing with bleed, poison trail, fire alternation, or fortify |
| Battle modifiers | `battleModifiers.ts`, `battle-mod` behavior, `battle-mod` enemy intent | ±10% to enemy attack, damage taken, shield gained, or damage dealt — player cards (Glitch/Hardwire/Patch/Overclock) and enemy intent chips stack through the enemy response |
| Echo | `echo` behavior, `echoReplay.ts` | Re-activates the previous chain card (damage, armor, battle modifiers) then activates itself |
| Hazards/traps | `hazardBehavior.ts`, `AttackPipeline.applyBombConversion` | Skip → slot explodes (4 dmg) + disables; **route a card into it (or start the chain on it and continue)** → the trap converts to that card's type (attack→attack for its power, defend→armor) and joins streaks/abilities. Enemies only place traps in the **last 3 columns** of the board. |
| **Curse cards** | `cards.json` (`unplayable`, `handEndPenalty`), `CardGameSession.resolveHandEndPenalties` | Bad cards that clog the hand — **Burden** (unplayable, 5 dmg if held at end of turn), **Fuse** (weak attack, 8 dmg if not placed by end of turn). **Saboteur** adds Burdens via `curseHand` passive |
| Shield layer | Both sides | Absorbs before HP (poison bypasses shield) |
| Enemy passives | `enemyPassives/` | See enemy roster below |

### Enemy roster (`cardGame/config/enemies.json`)

| ID | Counter-play |
|----|--------------|
| `basic` | Raider — baseline (HP 190, atk 13, 65% attack), no passives |
| `thornward` | Thorns — reflects 4 damage on attack (punishes multi-attack re-firing) |
| `saboteur` | Enrage (+3 atk per trap), Escalate (ramps traps +1/turn up to 4), Silence Tile, **Curse Hand** (adds Burden to hand each turn) — trap pressure snowballs. On the run map, saboteur nodes always connect to an adjacent route up or down on the next column. |
| `warden` | Wet Blanket (halves fire bonus), Jammer (+5 shield if chain ≥6), Last Stand (≤25% HP: atk 12, 2 traps) |
| `smokebinder` | Smoke (blocks poison stacks), Loop Hunter (punishes loop-reset), Dead Zone (telegraphed event: every 2 turns, cards on even checkerboard tiles deal half damage/armor next turn) |

Each enemy should force a **different deck shape and chain strategy**.

---

## Design goals: higher stakes, more tactical

### Principles

1. **Telegraphed threats** — player sees intent and has 1–2 turns to adapt.
2. **Tradeoffs, not correct answers** — long chain vs board coverage, spend rerolls now vs save.
3. **Enemy counters habits** — Jammer vs long chains, Smokebinder vs poison, Thornward vs all-in attack.
4. **Recoverable mistakes** — high stakes, but one bad turn should not auto-lose.

### Recommended roadmap

#### Phase 1 — Stakes (~1–2 weeks)

- [x] **Gauntlet / run map** — branching path of escalating enemies from `enemies.json` (`runMap.ts`, `RunMapOverlay`)
- [x] **Carry-over HP** — HP carries between fights with a small heal on victory (`RUN_CONFIG.healOnVictory`)
- [x] **Pre-fight enemy preview** — map nodes show the enemy label before you commit
- [x] **Node kinds** — enemy/boss/shop/event nodes with icons + hover tooltips (`nodeKinds.ts`, `NodeKindIcon`); shop/event are placeholders (`NodeVisitOverlay`)
- [ ] **Shop node** — spend creds on cards/body mods (replace `NodeVisitOverlay` placeholder)
- [ ] **Random event node** — branching choice encounters (replace `NodeVisitOverlay` placeholder)
- [ ] **Run-wide rerolls** — e.g. 5 per run instead of 3 per fight

#### Phase 2 — Spatial tactics (~1 week)

- [ ] **Column pressure** — enemy targets or disables specific columns
- [ ] **Threshold telegraphs** — HUD shows Last Stand / Enrage breakpoints
- [ ] **Perfect-fight rewards** — bonus reroll or card upgrade for clean wins

#### Phase 3 — Meta (~1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Unlock system (cards, enemies)
- [ ] Daily/weekly seeded challenge
- [ ] Ascension modifiers (+enemy HP, −rerolls, faster enemy turns)

### Anti-patterns (do not reintroduce)

- ~~Tower defense / wave spawning~~ — removed; not part of this game
- ~~Fusion, race adjacency, tower drafts~~ — removed
- ~~Spawn-column tower placement~~ — removed

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-07-14 | **Trap column restriction.** Enemy traps only spawn in the last three board columns (`gridConfig.isTrapPlacementColumn`, `placeEnemyHazard`). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Enemy intent layout.** Boxless telegraph: large tinted icon with Orbitron value below (dark stroke, no chip frame). Multi-step turns wrap onto extra rows within each panel so every step stays visible (no overlap with neighboring enemies). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Enemy intent during player turn.** `setDefeated(false)` no longer clears intent chips; `emitAttackReadiness` re-telegraphs upcoming enemy turns while the player deploys (hidden during enemy phase resolution). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Per-step chain activation.** Battle modifiers and defend armor apply when each card activates during the attack animation (not batched at `completeAttack`). Enemy intents refresh live as modifiers land; Echo replays apply on the Echo step. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Enemy row layout.** Multiple hostiles align left-to-right from the board edge (layout reserves width for 3 slots). Turn intent chips sit above each enemy panel, clear of the frame and shield badge. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Echo + Patch stacking.** Battle modifiers now resolve from the full chain in `completeAttack` (`chainBattleModifiers.ts`), so Patch → Echo correctly stacks to -20% damage taken. Presenter still shows per-step modifier VFX only. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Multi-enemy targeting UX.** Fights with multiple hostiles now lay out enemies left-to-right. When no target is locked, HUD shows a persistent prompt, the Attack button reads **Select Target**, and living enemies pulse with a **LOCK TARGET** badge until clicked. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Multi-enemy phase loop fix.** After the last enemy in a prepared phase acted, `playEnemyResponse` no longer called `beginEnemyTurn` again (which re-queued every living enemy and caused endless attacks). `hasMoreEnemyTurnsInPhase` gates the loop; `beginEnemyTurn` returns null when the prepared queue is drained. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Unified pile card visuals.** Deck/graveyard stacks and the pile inspector now use the same card chrome as the hand (`buildCardGraphic` / `buildCardBackGraphic`, React `CardChip`). Graveyard shows the top discard face-up; deck shows face-down backs. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Combat UI polish.** Modernized fight layout: larger player (**RUNNER**) and enemy frames with neon brackets, glow rings, and diamond avatars; board neon panel backdrop; layered hand/board cards with corner accents; fanned hand with hover lift; cyberpunk deck/graveyard piles and shield badge; HUD energy pips and Attack/Reroll buttons aligned to neon theme (`cyberpunkUiGraphics.ts`, `uiDisplayTextStyle`). |
| 2026-07-14 | **5×5 combat board.** Card grid expanded from 4×4 to 5×5 (`gridConfig.ts`, `tileSize` 80). Sign Matcher minigame stays 4×4. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Map label polish.** Regular fights show as **Street Op** on the map. All semi-boss nodes always show **Lieutenant** (including saboteur lieutenants). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Hidden map encounter names.** Map nodes show generic kind labels (Street Op, Lieutenant, Signal, Ripperdoc, Warden) instead of specific enemy/event titles. **Saboteur** (non-lieutenant) and **Warden** remain visible as named threats. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Saboteur map branching.** Nodes fighting the saboteur always link to adjacent routes on the next column (up and/or down), so clearing them opens a vertical path change. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Map node mix + semi-boss.** Middle columns roll 70% enemy / 20% event / 10% shop. Column 4 is always a **semi-boss** (`Lieutenant`: `smokebinder` or `saboteur`) with horned-skull map styling. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Longer run map.** Nine columns now sit between the first fight and the boss (11 columns total). Enemy pools ramp across the longer path; branching uses a wider bell curve (`ROW_SIZES`). |
| 2026-07-14 | **First column is always enemy.** Column 0 now always rolls `enemy` nodes (basic pool) so every run opens with a fight. Removed the column-0 Sign Matcher guarantee; events still roll in later columns. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Cyberpunk naming pass.** Trinkets renamed to **body mods** (`bodyMods.ts`): Chrome Heart, Overclock Cell, Cred Siphon. Run currency shown as **creds**; map labels use Integrity / Body Mods. Events retitled (Fate Spinner, Glyph Matcher, Stasis Patch, Black ICE Relic, Neural Drill, Chrome Dealer). Node kinds: Hostile, Warden, Ripperdoc, Signal. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Enemy responds after each attack.** The enemy now acts immediately after every player attack (graveyard → board clear → enemy turn), not only when energy is depleted. Energy persists across these exchanges and refills only after the last attack in a round (energy = 0). Hand renews after each enemy turn. Damage ramp still stacks for extra attacks within the same energy round. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Per-step player armor.** Defend armor now applies when each chain card finishes (`grantPlayerShield` during presentation), not in one batch at attack end. Thorns reflect during a later chain step can be blocked by shield from an earlier defend. `completeAttack` only adds armor not already granted mid-chain. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Cyberpunk theme + animation polish.** Neon cyan/magenta palette across React overlays (`cyberpunk-theme.css`: Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, scanline grid, panel glow) and Phaser canvas (`cyberpunkTheme.ts`). Shared combat tweens (`visualEffectTweens.ts`) — snappier card glow pulses, hit flashes, floating damage numbers. Board slots, card colors, health bars, chain-start indicator, and graveyard discard animation updated to match. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Thorns trigger on hit.** Thorns now reflects damage whenever you deal attack damage to the enemy — shield is no longer required. Fires per damage step in the chain (e.g. attack then defend still procs thorns on the attack). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Event map labels.** Event nodes now roll their encounter at **map generation** (`RunMapNode.eventId`) and show the title on the map (e.g. **Sign Matcher**). Column 0 always places Sign Matcher on the first event node; siblings in the same column get distinct events. Picking a node uses the pre-rolled id (no surprise reroll). Sign Matcher weight raised to match other headliners. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Wheel of Fate visuals.** Wheel now shows segment icons on a skewed face — curse/damage slices are drawn larger (~42% of the wheel) so bad luck *looks* more likely, but `rollWheelSegment` odds stay equal. Spin animation lands using visual mid-angles (`wheelDisplay.ts`). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Combo trial rewards + rules + difficulty.** Passing a combo trial now opens a **3-card reward picker** (take one or none) instead of auto-adding a random card. Trial rules shown on brief, in-fight HUD, and reward overlay (`PUZZLE_TRIAL_RULES`, `BATTLE_REWARD_RULES`). Damage targets raised across all puzzles; failure damage increased. Battle victory overlay also shows rules and allows skipping the card reward via **Take nothing**. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Sign Matcher memory game.** Sign Matcher is now a 4×4 (16-tile) picture-matching minigame: eight icon pairs, flip two per attempt, **4 attempts** to match as many pairs as possible. Rewards scale with pairs matched (gold tiers; 3+ pairs adds a card with gold/HP costs; 0 pairs deals damage). Seeded grid via `buildIconMatchGrid`. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Code tidy-up.** Body-mod battle stats route through `runResources`; `Game.syncBoardFromSession()` dedupes board sync; battle-mod presenter logic shared; dead telegraph alias removed; event types aligned; first-column test grunts reverted to 2× basic. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Body mod panel.** Persistent run UI lists installed body mods with effect text. Mark VII shows a run-wide attack counter (`4/7`) that updates live during fights and highlights when the next attack is charged. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Exhaust is battle-scoped.** `exhaustOnPlay` cards are destroyed for the current fight only (skip graveyard, no reshuffle). They stay in your run deck and return in the next battle. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Multi-enemy fights.** Battles can spawn multiple enemies (`enemyIds` on map nodes; first column is 2× basic). Click an enemy to select your attack target. Mid-chain retargeting when the current target dies. Each living enemy acts after every player attack. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Salvage card.** 4-damage attack, exhaust on play. If its damage kills an enemy, heal 5 HP. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Modifier rounding.** Incoming damage mods (Patch/Glitch/enemy intents) combine then round **down** once in the defender's favor (13 at −10% → 11, not 12). Player buff mods (Hardwire/Overclock) round **up**. Stacked reductions no longer double-floor. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Glitch duration.** Glitch now lasts the full energy round (`energy-round` modifier duration) — enemy attack stays -10% across multiple attacks until energy refills. Other battle-mod cards still expire after each enemy turn. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Echo card.** New `echo` behavior replays the previous chain step when activated — repeats its resolved damage, armor, and battle modifiers, then Echo activates normally. Starter deck includes one Echo (replaces a second Joker). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Battle modifiers (±10%).** New `battle-mod` system (`battleModifiers.ts`): four stats — enemy attack, damage taken, shield gained, damage dealt — stack in ±10% steps. Player cards: **Glitch** (-enemy atk, lasts until energy refills), **Hardwire** (+shield), **Patch** (-damage taken), **Overclock** (+damage dealt). Enemy intents can telegraph the same modifiers before attack/traps. Most modifiers expire after each enemy turn; Glitch persists for the energy round. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Per-step shield feedback.** Defend armor now grants when each card finishes (not when the next starts): `+N` floats on the card and shield HUD, so thorns on the following attack visibly hits shield first. Thorns splits shield absorb vs HP damage in the presenter. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Enemy intent + card variety.** Enemy intent chips no longer pulse — they fade in once with a static framed chip. Six new combo cards: **Shiv** (diagonal bleed), **Miasma** (diagonal poison), **Cinder** (diagonal fire), **Lacerate** (lunge bleed), **Scorch** (corner fire), **Bramble** (corner fortify) — each with distinct colors. Starter deck now mixes basics with Shiv/Cinder/Miasma/Lacerate/Rupture/Bulwark; reward pool expanded with specials, leaps, and all combo cards. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Deck pile view.** Draw pile inspector shows each card face-up, grouped by type and sorted alphabetically; draw order stays hidden. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Trap-first chain fix.** Starting an attack on an enemy trap now converts that trap from the next chain card's type (same bomb-conversion rule as routing into a trap), so the chain deals damage/armor and continues instead of stalling. `Game.onAttackResolved` always releases the attack lock even when turn UI is unavailable; attack animation timers are tracked for cleanup. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Courier + exhaust cards + smaller hand.** **Courier** discards up to 2 cards from the left of hand into the graveyard when played (includes unplayable curse cards). New `discardFromHandOnPlay` and `exhaustOnPlay` on `CardDefinition` — exhaust cards are destroyed for that fight only (not graveyard, not reshuffled). Starting hand **8** (`gameRules.handSize`). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Corner Defense readability.** Single arrow tucked in the card corner (no dual hook preview); tooltip copy simplified. Corner Strike keeps the hook preview. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Player round gating.** Board persists and the enemy does not act until **all** energy is spent. Manual End Turn removed (it was ending the round early). `endPlayerRound` runs only when `energy === 0` → graveyard animation → `clearBoard` → single enemy turn. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Escalating turn restore.** Board and deployed cards persist until all energy is spent; `onAttackResolved` only calls `endPlayerRound` when `energy === 0`. Mid-round attacks refill the hand and place a field boost without clearing the board or triggering the enemy. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Event trade-offs.** Every positive event outcome now pairs with a cost (`lose-gold` caps at current gold; HP damage or curse cards for other rewards). Healing Spring: +18 HP / −18 gold. Wheel: spin costs 5 gold; gold/heal/card/trinket segments also cost HP, gold, or Burden. Sign Matcher win costs 12 gold. Gambler coin and Cursed Idol smash cost HP. Combo Trial success pays mirror gold costs and curse tax on bonus cards. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Combo Trial events.** New **Combo Trial** random event launches a seeded damage puzzle (`runPuzzles.ts`, `START_PUZZLE` / `PUZZLE_RESOLVED`). Player receives a fixed hand of combo cards against a **Training Dummy** (`training-dummy` enemy, no counterattack) and must deal at least the target damage in **one attack**. Six puzzles teach Boost, attack streaks, Strike loops, Fire alternation, Loop Reset, and Rupture bleed. Success grants gold/cards; failure costs a little HP. Puzzle UI: brief screen in `RunEventOverlay`, in-fight goal/hint in `PuzzleHud`, result in `PuzzleResultOverlay`. |
| 2026-07-14 | **Random run events.** Map `event` nodes now open `RunEventOverlay` with seeded encounters (`runEvents.ts`, `seedScope(seed, event:<nodeId>)`). Five events: **Wheel of Fate** (spin for gold/card/curse/trinket/heal/trap), **Sign Matcher** (pick the duplicated icon — card or damage), **Healing Spring**, **Cursed Idol** (trinket + Burden or gold), **Gambler's Offer** (HP for card or gold). First map column is now **all events** for easy testing. Run resources: **gold** + **trinkets** (`trinkets.ts`, `runResources.ts`) shown on the map; trinkets pass into battles (`START_BATTLE.trinkets`) — Vitality Charm (+10 max HP), Energy Cell (+1 energy/turn), Lucky Pouch (+8 gold on victory). Shop nodes remain a placeholder (`NodeVisitOverlay` shows gold). |
| 2026-07-14 | **Curse / bad cards.** New card flags `unplayable` and `handEndPenalty` on `CardDefinition`. **Burden** — cannot be played, deals 5 damage if still in hand when the turn ends. **Fuse** — weak attack (power 2) that must be placed before end of turn or deals 8 damage. Penalties resolve in `CardGameSession.resolveHandEndPenalties` at end of player turn (`Game.resolveEnemyPhase`). Unplayable cards blocked in `placeCardFromHand` and `CardHandView` drag. New `curse` behavior (inert on board). **Saboteur** gains `curseHand` passive — slips 1 Burden into your hand after each enemy turn (can exceed hand size). |
| 2026-07-07 | **Escalation risk/reward: enemy damage ramps with attacks per round.** Each extra attack the player makes in a round increases the enemy's next attack damage by `gameRules.enemyDamageRampPerAttack` (default 4; first attack is baseline). Ramp derives from spent energy (`CardGameSession.getAttacksThisRound` = `maxEnergy − energy`, `getEnemyDamageRamp`), is baked into attack steps at resolve time (`beginEnemyTurn` → `rampEnemyAction`), and is telegraphed live: after each attack `Game.onAttackResolved` re-shows the scaled intent (`getScaledEnemyIntent`). Attack intent tooltip notes the ramp. |
| 2026-07-07 | **Enemy balance pass for the escalating turn** (`enemies.json`). Since a turn now lands up to `energyPerTurn` re-firing attacks, enemy `maxHealth` scaled ~2.3× (Raider 80→190, Thornward 72→170, Saboteur 64→150, Warden 95→220, Smokebinder 78→185) with moderate `attackDamage`/`shieldGain`/`attackChance` bumps so escalating shields don't trivialize them. Thornward's reflect 3→4 and Warden's high shield/Jammer act as natural counters to multi-attack re-firing. Tunable per taste. |
| 2026-07-07 | **Escalating turn / dynamic play.** A player turn is no longer one-and-done: Attack now resolves the board **without clearing it**, so cards stay and each subsequent Attack chains through a longer, escalating sequence. Each Attack costs **1 energy** (`gameRules.energyPerTurn`, default 3, on `GameRules`); the hand refills to full after every attack (`CardGameSession.refillHand`) so the deck progresses mid-turn. New **End Turn** button (`GAME_EVENTS.END_TURN`) — or running out of energy — discards the board and hands off to the enemy (`Game.onEndTurn` → `resolveEnemyPhase`, formerly the post-attack path). Energy state (`getEnergy`/`getMaxEnergy`/`hasEnergy`/`spendEnergy`, reset each turn in `completeEnemyTurn`) surfaces via `GAME_EVENTS.TURN_STATE` → HUD energy pips + End Turn button (`GameHud`, `TurnState`). New readiness reason `no-energy`. Board edits are locked during end-turn resolution via a `turnResolving` guard in `Game`. Dead Zone/dampen now ages once per turn (`CardGameSession.tickDampenField`, called in `resolveEnemyPhase`) instead of per attack. |
| 2026-07-07 | **Pile inspection:** the Deck and Graveyard piles are now clickable (`CardPileView.setClickHandler`, hover highlight). Clicking emits `pile-view-open` (`GAME_EVENTS.PILE_VIEW_OPEN`) with grouped card entries built in `Game.openPileView` from `CardGameSession.getDeckDefinitionIds`/`getDiscardDefinitionIds`. A React modal (`PileViewOverlay`, mounted in `App`) shows the cards grouped by type with counts and power, colored by behavior (`CARD_VISUALS`). The deck is sorted alphabetically by label; draw order is still hidden. Closes on backdrop click / × / Escape. |
| 2026-07-07 | New **corner-turn** cards **Corner Strike** (attack, power 6) and **Corner Defense** (defend, power 5) in `cards.json`, flagged `cornerTurn` (`CardDefinition`). The chain steps one tile along the orthogonal arrow then hooks 90° to a forward-diagonal tile, taking whichever side holds a card (fixed order → seed-deterministic) via `AttackPipeline.getCornerNextSlot` + `cardDirections.cornerTargetDirections`; wired into `planActivationChain` and `getNextChainSlotFromStep`. Card shows both hook glyphs (`CardRenderer`), has tooltips, and is added to `REWARD_CARD_POOL`. |
| 2026-07-07 | Enemy traps now spread out: `CardGameSession.placeEnemyHazard` prefers empty tiles that are not orthogonally/diagonally adjacent to an existing trap, falling back to any empty tile on a crowded board. |
| 2026-07-07 | **Dead Zone is now a telegraphed enemy event** (not a permanent passive). The `dampenTiles` ability gains `everyTurns` (cadence) + `duration`; `planEnemyTurnWithPassives` emits a `dampen-field` turn step (new `EnemyTurnKind`) on cadence turns, shown in the enemy intent (icon `empty-chessboard`, tooltip, visual). Resolving it calls `CardGameSession.activateDampenField`, which stores a `dampenField` (parity/multiplier/turnsRemaining). While active, `buildAttackSequence` runs `applyTileDampening` (halves damage/armor of cards on the checkerboard tiles, re-deriving `steps`/`totalDamage`); the field ticks down and expires in `completeAttack`. Weakened tiles are highlighted via `CardBoardView.setDampenedSlots` / `getDampenedSlots`. It is surfaced only through the turn intent (filtered out of the passive-icon row in `EnemyTargetView`). Added to `smokebinder`. |
| 2026-07-07 | New enemy passive **Escalate** (`enemyPassives/types.ts`, `defaults.ts`): each enemy turn ramps the traps placed next turn by `trapsPerRamp` (default +1) up to `maxTraps` (default 4). A per-battle turn counter (`enemyTurnsTaken`, passed to planning as `turnsTaken`) lives in `CardGameSession` and increments per completed enemy turn; planning + cap in `planEnemyTurnWithPassives`. Wired icon (`minefield`), tooltip, label, color. Added to `saboteur` (its Enrage extra-traps set to 0 so the ramp is the single trap source). |
| 2026-07-07 | Battle engagement pass. **Tier 1:** raised enemy pressure (`enemies.json` — higher atk/attack-chance, thorns 3, enrage +3), buffed streaks (+15%/dup) and off-chain (+2), sped up resolution (chain/enemy step 800ms), scaled traps (power 4). **Tier 2:** new chain abilities Bleed/Fortify/Overload with reward cards Rupture/Bulwark/Surge (`bleedAbility`/`fortifyAbility`/`overloadAbility`, `cards.json`, `REWARD_CARD_POOL`). **Poison rework:** poison now applies *stacks* to the enemy (`EnemyState.poison`) that deal damage at the start of each enemy turn (ignoring shield) then decay by 1 (`CardGameSession.tickPoison`); `abilityPoisonStacks` flows through the pipeline; smoke suppresses stacks; shown via `EnemyTargetView.setPoison`; poison can kill during the enemy turn (win handled in `Game`). **Bomb conversion:** a card that chains into a trap converts it to that card's type (`AttackPipeline.applyBombConversion`), so it deals attack/armor for the trap's power and joins streaks/abilities. |
| 2026-07-07 | Map node kinds: nodes are now `enemy`/`boss`/`shop`/`event` (`nodeKinds.ts`) with distinct icons (`NodeKindIcon`) and hover tooltips (`RunMapOverlay`). Shop/event are non-battle placeholders (`NodeVisitOverlay`, `App` phase `visit`) that advance the path. `RunMapNode.enemyId`/`reward` are now battle-only (optional). |
| 2026-07-07 | Seed-based runs: all randomness routes through a seeded RNG (`random/rng.ts`), reseeded at deterministic boundaries (map / reward / battle). Same seed → same map & rewards; same seed + actions → same battle. Seed viewable/editable on the map before the first fight. |
| 2026-07-07 | Added victory rewards: defeating an enemy grants a card (`rewards.ts`, `CardRewardOverlay`). Run now owns a persistent, growing deck (card ids) passed into each battle. Rewards are variable per node and structured for future trinkets (`pickCount`, `rerollable`, new `RunReward` kinds). |
| 2026-07-07 | Added run map: branching node/line overworld between battles (`runMap.ts`, `RunMapOverlay`), carry-over HP with heal-on-victory, victory/defeat run-end screens. Scene now starts/ends battles on `START_BATTLE`/`BATTLE_WON`/`BATTLE_LOST` events. |
| 2026-07-07 | Initial doc. Removed obsolete TD subsystem from codebase. Design focus: card-chain combat only. |
